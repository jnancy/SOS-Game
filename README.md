## SOS (game)
### General Info:
- plays a game of SOS
- only player vs player version completed (player vs computer is still being developed)

### Complete rules: 
* a grid of any size is drawn (usually > 5x5)
* two players take turns adding either an "S" or an "O" to an empty square in the grid
* they do not have to use the same letter each turn
* if the player creates at least one SOS (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), they take another turn, and continue to do so until they can no longer create any
* once the board is full, the player with the most SOSs is the winner
* [see more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS_(game))

### TLDR rules: 
- a more complex (and fun!) version of tic-tac-toe
